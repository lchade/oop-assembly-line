# Milestone 3 Specifications
###### Assembly Line â€“ Stations and Line Manager

## Modules

- project (supplied)
- AssemblyLine (supplied)
- Utilities (from Milestone 1)
- ItemSet (from Milestone 1)
- CustomerOrder (from Milestone 2)
-	Station

The Station module contains all the functionality for filling customer orders with items. Each station that has an order can fill one request at a time for an item from that station. An order can be incomplete due to insufficient items in stock to cover its requests.

The Station class is designed for managing a set of identical items (with different serial numbers) and processing a queue of customer orders. Each station object is unique and hence neither copyable, moveable, copy-assignable nor move-assignable. Each Station contains a CustomerOrder queue and an ItemSet sub-object. A Station object fills a customer request from the items in its ItemSet sub-object. The name of a Station object is the name of its ItemSet sub_object.

-	LineManager

The Line Manager module contains all the functionality for processing customer orders across the entire assembly line. The line manager moves orders along the assembly line one step at a time. At each step, each station fills one order. The manager moves orders that are ready from station to station. Once an order has reached the end of the line, it is either completed or is incomplete. An order can be incomplete due to insufficient items in stock to cover its requests.

The LineManager class is designed for managing all the stations on the assembly line and processing a vector of customer orders. 


## Output

The output from the executable running Visual Studio with the following command line argument should look like:

```
Command Line : C:\Users\...\Debug\MS3.exe Inventory.txt CustomerOrders.txt AssemblyLine.txt
